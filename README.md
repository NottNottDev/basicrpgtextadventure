One of my first real programming things in Python, attack four pretdetermined monsters, with a chance to obtain three pretdetermined items after every move!

Pretty happy with this for a first real project, just your typical newbie trying to get into programming for the first time and chuffed with some of the systems coded. Neither the monsters or the items are hardcoded into the game, rather there's a system in place for dynamically assigning new monsters or items based on function calls if needed. Although this feature isn't actually used in v1.1, this could be added if need be. Another personal highlight is the inventory system, which dynamically assigns menu options according to what is in the inventory and what is not. Super basic stuff to anyone else, but pretty good for a beginner. The attack system is obviously a reference to UNDERTALE, even if the fleshed out mechanics of that actual game are completely missing from this (no bullet hell, no variable timing attack damage, no complex 'act' actions for each monster, mercy on an enemy does nothing except skipping your turn etc.)

It's all inside one file because I didn't feel right spreading out a lot of definitions across several files. Just feels like newbie projects should all belong inside one newbie file, meh :D

`line 12: version = '1.1'  # How fucking pretentious do you have to be to include a version number in something like this`
